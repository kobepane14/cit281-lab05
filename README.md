<p>Dowload and create a CIT collection on Postman. Use Postman to test server get routes, and respond to the client with JSON data. Use request parameters to send back specific requested data from the students array, and create a new post route to handle the addition of a new student to the array. I learned how to use Postman to test all types of routes, and test responses to the client. I also learned how to handle a get route and update certain data with what the client provided.</p>
